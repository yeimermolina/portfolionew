      <p className="About__description">
        I am a Software Engineer from Venezuela, but during the last 3 years I
        have been living in the beautiful city of Medell√≠n, Colombia. I have
        been working professionally for around 5 years and since then I had the
        opportunity of working with both backend and frontend technologies.
        However at some point of my career I found my passion as Frontend
        developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        My Strongest skill is Javascript, specifically using libraries like
        React and Vue.js and their related libraries ecosystem (Redux, React
        Router, NextJS, Vue Router, Vuex to name a few). I had worked mostly
        with those two technologies in tasks including API integrations,
        transform designs into specific components/pages, development of unit
        tests, accessibility compliance. etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have also been involved in tasks including backend work with
        technologies like Django and Django Rest Framework, NodeJs and some
        databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
